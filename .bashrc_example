# The following is an example of how to use bmk with a function ('jmp' in this
# case) to make jumping to your bookmarked directories easier. If you use a
# function named something other than 'jmp' and wish to have tab-completion
# work with it, you will have to update the jmp completion scripts for your
# function.

# This function calls 'bmk' with the supplied arguments, changing directories to
# whatever text is printed on stdout. 'bmk' sends all output to stderr except
# for the bookmark path itself, so this will not fail if an error occurs.
jmp() {
	dir=$(bmk $@)
	[[ -n "$dir" ]] && cd $dir
}

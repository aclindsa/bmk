README for bmk,
A shell directory bookmarking tool
Copyright (C) 2013: Aaron Lindsay <aaron@aclindsay.com>

This tool is fairly self-explanatory, and its options can be explored using
'-h'. It allows you to create named bookmarks which point to directories in
your filesystem and to easily retrieve/use those bookmarks. There is an example
in .bashrc_example that demonstrates how to create a shell function to change
directories from within your shell without having to do ugly things such as:
	$ cd `bmk bookmark_name`

Additionally, there are shell tab-completion scripts for bash and zsh in their
respective directories under completion/.
